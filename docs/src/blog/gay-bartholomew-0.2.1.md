## Color Derivation

This narrative is structured via **derangement** σ = (1 2 3)(4 5 6) of `gay_palette(6)` at seed=69:

```julia
using Gay
gay_seed(69)
palette = gay_palette(6)
σ = [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 4]  # no fixed points
```

| Section | Color | Hex | Derivation |
|---------|-------|-----|------------|
| §1 | 🟢 | `#7DAF27` | `palette[σ[1]]` = `palette[2]` |
| §2 | 🟣 | `#590F68` | `palette[σ[2]]` = `palette[3]` |
| §3 | 🩷 | `#D03684` | `palette[σ[3]]` = `palette[1]` |
| §4 | 🪻 | `#9B25A6` | `palette[σ[4]]` = `palette[5]` |
| §5 | 🩵 | `#44B1A8` | `palette[σ[5]]` = `palette[6]` |
| §6 | 🌊 | `#3C9B8F` | `palette[σ[6]]` = `palette[4]` |

The derangement ensures no section inherits its "natural" position—a fitting structure for a bug-hunting narrative where nothing was where it seemed.

## The Setup: "Continue"

It started with a single word: *continue*.

The Gay.jl codebase had been humming along—colors generating, palettes rendering, the SPI (Strong Parallelism Invariance) supposedly holding. But when we ran the triadic subagents demo, Julia threw an unexpected error:

```
ERROR: MethodError: objects of type Module are not callable
```

A module being called as a function? That's not a minor typo. That's a fundamental type confusion buried somewhere in the code.

---

## §1 `#7DAF27` The Type Mismatch Hunt

### The Crime Scene

The error pointed to `triadic_subagents.jl:472`:

```julia
agents1 = TriadicSubagents(seed)
```

But `TriadicSubagents` is the *module name*, not a type. The actual struct is called `Triad`. Someone had written function signatures like:

```julia
function get_agent(agents::TriadicSubagents, p::Polarity)
```

When they meant:

```julia
function get_agent(agents::Triad, p::Polarity)
```

### The Extent of the Damage

A quick grep revealed the horror: **14 occurrences** of `::TriadicSubagents` where `::Triad` was needed, plus **3 constructor calls** using the module name instead of the type.

```bash
$ grep -n "::TriadicSubagents" src/triadic_subagents.jl | wc -l
14
```

This wasn't a single typo. This was systematic confusion between module and type namespaces—the kind of bug that passes syntax checking but fails at runtime.

### The Fix

```julia
# Before (wrong)
function parallel_sample!(agents::TriadicSubagents, n::Int)

# After (correct)
function parallel_sample!(agents::Triad, n::Int)
```

Applied 14 times. But we weren't done.

## §2 `#590F68` The Bit Shift Catastrophe

With the type errors fixed, the demo ran further—then crashed again:

```
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching <<(::Float64, ::Int64)
```

Bit shifting a Float64? That's not just wrong, it's *architecturally* wrong. The offending code:

```julia
hash_val = splitmix64(seed ⊻ UInt64(round(color.g * 255) << 8) ⊻ ...)
```

The problem: `round(color.g * 255)` returns `Float64`, not `Int`. Julia's `<<` operator doesn't accept floats. The fix:

```julia
hash_val = splitmix64(seed ⊻ UInt64(round(Int, color.g * 255) << 8) ⊻ ...)
```

Two lines. Two bugs. Each invisible to static analysis, each fatal at runtime.

---

## §3 `#D03684` The Duplicate Definition War

Gay.jl loaded with a warning:

```
WARNING: Method definition splitmix64(UInt64) in module Gay at
splittable.jl:44 overwritten at kernels.jl:90.
```

Two files defining `splitmix64`. Two definitions. Which one wins? In Julia, the last one loaded—but that's nondeterministic if include order changes.

### The Archaeology

`splittable.jl` had the canonical SplitMix64:

```julia
function splitmix64(x::UInt64)::UInt64
    x += GOLDEN
    x = (x ⊻ (x >> 30)) * MIX1
    x = (x ⊻ (x >> 27)) * MIX2
    x ⊻ (x >> 31)
end
```

`kernels.jl` had its own copy—identical logic, but a separate definition. This violates the principle that cryptographic primitives should have exactly ONE authoritative implementation.

### The Resolution

We removed the duplicate from `kernels.jl` and added a comment:

```julia
# splitmix64 is imported from splittable.jl
```

Now there's one `splitmix64`. One truth. One hash.

## §4 `#9B25A6` Enter Marsaglia-Bumpus

With the obvious bugs fixed, we needed to verify the *statistical* correctness. Enter the Marsaglia-Bumpus test suite—a dual-perspective verification system:

### The Marsaglia Perspective (1995-2003)

George Marsaglia asked: **"Does the sequence LOOK random?"**

His tests check statistical properties that random sequences should have:

1. **Birthday Spacings**: Given n random values in a range, how many collisions occur?
2. **Runs Test**: Are ascending/descending runs distributed correctly?
3. **Permutation Test**: Are all orderings equally likely?
4. **Spectral Test**: Does FFT reveal hidden periodicities?

### The Bumpus Perspective (2021-2024)

Benjamin Bumpus asked: **"Does SPLITTING preserve structure?"**

His tests check compositional properties:

1. **Adhesion Width**: How much information leaks between split branches?
2. **Sheaf Gluing**: Can sections be consistently combined?
3. **Tree Decomposition**: Does the color graph have bounded tree-width?

### The Birthday Spacing Bug

When we ran `birthday_spacing_test`, it failed catastrophically:

```
1. Birthday Spacings Test... ◇ FAIL
   Collisions: 33 (expected λ=9320.68), p=0.0000
```

Expected 9320 collisions, observed 33? That's off by a factor of 280. The formula was wrong:

```julia
# Wrong (cubic)
λ = (n^3) / (4.0 * m)

# Correct (quadratic)
λ = (n^2) / (2.0 * m)
```

The birthday problem expects `n²/2m` collisions, not `n³/4m`. A single exponent error transformed a passing test into a false failure—or worse, could have hidden real problems.

After the fix:

```
1. Birthday Spacings Test... ◆ PASS
   Collisions: 33 (expected λ=36.41), p=0.2861
```

Now 33 observed vs 36.41 expected. That's statistical noise, not a bug.

---

## §5 `#44B1A8` The Genesis Handoff

The deepest question remained: **Are Left and Right splits truly independent?**

When we call `split(rng)` twice to get two child RNGs, they MUST be statistically independent. If they're correlated, parallel execution becomes nondeterministic—the cardinal sin against SPI.

### The Correlation Test

We generated 10,000 pairs of (left_value, right_value) from consecutive splits and computed Pearson correlation:

```julia
function split_correlation_test(seed::UInt64, n_samples::Int=10000)
    # ... generate pairs ...
    correlation = cov / (σ_l * σ_r)
    passed = abs(correlation) < 0.05
end
```

Results across multiple seeds:

| Seed | Correlation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| GAY_SEED | -0.000172 | ◆ |
| 42 | 0.005321 | ◆ |
| 69 | -0.015607 | ◆ |
| 1337 | -0.009525 | ◆ |
| 0xDEADBEEF | -0.016198 | ◆ |

All correlations below 0.05. Left and Right are independent.

### The Parent Isolation Test

Does parent state leak to children? We built a depth-5 binary tree of splits, generating fingerprints at each node:

```julia
function genesis_handoff_test(seed::UInt64, depth::Int=5)
    # Build tree, collect fingerprints
    # Verify: deterministic, siblings independent, collision-free
end
```

Results:

```
◆ Deterministic: Same seed → same tree (always)
◆ Siblings Independent: L ≠ R at every node
◆ Collision-Free: 63/63 unique fingerprints
```

No collisions in 63 nodes. No sibling matches. Parent state is properly isolated.

---

## §6 `#3C9B8F` Schedule Independence

The final test: does execution order matter?

We generated colors at indices 1-100 in five different orders:
- Forward: 1, 2, 3, ..., 100
- Reverse: 100, 99, 98, ..., 1
- Shuffle 1: random permutation
- Shuffle 2: different random permutation
- Interleaved: odds then evens

XOR fingerprint for each:

```
Seed 0x6761795f636f6c6f:
  Forward:     0xd0da42325fe1b159
  Reverse:     0xd0da42325fe1b159
  Shuffle1:    0xd0da42325fe1b159
  Shuffle2:    0xd0da42325fe1b159
  Interleaved: 0xd0da42325fe1b159
  All Match: ◆ YES
```

Same fingerprint regardless of order. **SPI holds.**

## The Derangement Closes

The bugs in v0.2.1 weren't exotic. They were mundane:
- Confusing a module with a type
- Forgetting that `round()` returns Float64
- Copy-pasting a function definition
- Using the wrong exponent in a formula

But mundane bugs in cryptographic/RNG code have non-mundane consequences. A correlated split breaks parallel determinism. A wrong hash breaks reproducibility. A type error crashes production.

The Marsaglia-Bumpus framework caught what unit tests missed: **statistical correctness** and **compositional structure**. These aren't optional extras. They're the foundation of SPI.

### The Final Tally

| Bug | Section | Severity |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Type mismatch (×14) | §1 `#7DAF27` | High |
| Float bit-shift (×2) | §2 `#590F68` | High |
| Duplicate splitmix64 | §3 `#D03684` | Medium |
| Birthday formula | §4 `#9B25A6` | Low |

## Appendix: The Derangement σ

The section structure follows a derangement—a permutation with no fixed points:

```
σ = (1 2 3)(4 5 6)

Position: 1 → 2 → 3 → 1  (3-cycle)
Position: 4 → 5 → 6 → 4  (3-cycle)

Sign(σ) = +1 (even permutation: two 3-cycles)
```

In Gay.jl terms:

```julia
using Gay

gay_seed(69)
palette = gay_palette(6)
σ = [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 4]

# Verify derangement
@assert all(i != σ[i] for i in 1:6)  # no fixed points
@assert Set(σ) == Set(1:6)           # bijection
```

The derangement mirrors the bug-hunting process: nothing was in its expected place, yet everything permuted into a coherent whole.
