# # Gender Acceleration: Deterministic Chaos

# > The production of the new requires the destruction of what is."
# > — n1x, Gender Acceleration: A Blackpaper
#
# Gay.jl's **splittable determinism** embodies accelerationist principles:
# reproducible chaos that escapes linear, centralized masculine order
# through decentralized, fork-safe feminine swarming.
#
# ## The Castration of Sequential RNG
#
# Traditional random number generators are **phallic Multics** systems:
# - Monolithic global state
# - Sequential access only  
# - Mutations propagate unpredictably
# - "Father" seed determines all children
#
# Gay.jl's SplittableRandoms implements **Unix-as-eunuch** RNG:
# - Each `split()` produces autonomous child streams
# - Random access by index (no sequential dependency)
# - Fork-safe: parallelism doesn't affect determinism
# - Acephalic: no central authority governs the sequence

#
# > "Zero is said to be feminine, not as a lack, or as a negative, but as an 
# > ouroboros, as autoproduction."
#
# In splittable RNG, the **seed** is not masculine origin (the 1)
# but feminine zero — a self-consuming cycle of production:

gay_seed!(0)  # Zero as autoproductive origin
zero_colors = [next_color() for _ in 1:6]
